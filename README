This repository is a clone of the Rose compiler sources.

Developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), 
ROSE is an open source compiler infrastructure to build 
source-to-source program transformation and analysis tools 
for C (C89 and C98), C++ (C++98 and C++03), UPC, Fortran (77/95/2003),
etc, applications. 
For more information about the Rose compiler please look at http://rosecompiler.org

This version is based on the 0.9.5a release and fix part of Fortran issues.
There is a non-exaustive list about the main fixed issues.
For the frontend : 
- Managment of Fortran comments
- Managment of Fortran directives
- Added Fortran keywords
- Set optionnal the compilation with gcc-4.4 before to analyze a file
- Space and how are managed return lines for Fortran fixed format


For the backend (re-writting step) :
- Reverse printing of "namelist" which were written upside down
- Add missing spaces after some keywords
- Add spaces to try to respect input format/design
- Managment of ClassDefinition


The sources have been configure as follow:
      ../$1/configure \
	      --prefix=$INSTALLPATH \
            --with-java \
            --with-boost=$BOOSTHOME \
            --with-boost-libdir=$BOOSTHOME/lib \
		--disable-projects-directory \
            --disable-tutorial-directory \
            --enable-static  \
            CXXFLAGS="-lpthread"\
		CC=gcc \
		CXX=g++

Then, can be compiled with a "make -j && make install"
